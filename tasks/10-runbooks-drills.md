## Goal
Create runbooks for kill-switch, reconciliation failures, and automation rollbacks; schedule drill exercises.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Drill schedule and checklist stored in `docs/runbooks/drills.md`.
- One drill executed and results captured in `docs/runbooks/drill-results.md`.

## Files to change

## Next Steps

2. Schedule a tabletop and an execution drill in staging.
